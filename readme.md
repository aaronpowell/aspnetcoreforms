# WebForms for ASP.NET Core

Everyone misses the good ol' days of ASP.NET development with WebForms so this simple Tag Helper aims to bring back what you love about them, the `runat="server"` attribute!

# Let me have it!

Once you add the Tag Helper you can decorate your HTML elements to your heart's content:

```html
<body runat="server">
    <h1>Isn't this awesome?</h1>
</body>
```

If you mistype `server` you'll receive a lovely `ParseException`, just like the old days!
